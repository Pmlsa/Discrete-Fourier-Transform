# Discrete-Fourier-Transform
A python implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform.

The source code for our demo can be found in the _main.py_ file. Also, I included a sample .wav audio recording of a violin playing an "A" note. The program graphs the frequency domain of the audio sample. The DFT was programed without using any external libraries, exept for the math module and a popular graphing library _matplotlib_.
